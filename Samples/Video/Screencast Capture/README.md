# [Screencast Capture Lite](http://cesarsouza.github.io/screencast-capture/)

*Screencast Capture Lite* is a tool for recording the desktop screen and saving it to a video file, preserving quality as much as possible. However, this does not mean it produces gigantic files which take a long time to be uploaded to the web. The application encodes everything using solely H624 in an almost lossless setting.<br />

_To check the quality of the encoding, please be sure to leave Youtube quality settings on HD (720p)._

The application currently supports recording from the primary screen, from a chosen window or from a fixed region. There are few options to configure encoding at this time, mostly on purpose to keep things simple.

The software stores videos on the _My Videos_ directory and allows the user to browse them directly from within the application. The software has just been released, so it is expected to have a few bugs. If you wish, please leave any issues you encounter at the [project issue tracker](https://github.com/cesarsouza/screencast-capture/issues).

## Build your own applications

Screencast Capture Lite is also a live demonstration of the [Accord.NET Framework](http://accord-framework.net) in a real-world application.
